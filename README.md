# Game-Racko

Run it, the instructions of the game is provided in progress of the game.

There are a discard pile and a deck in public. But each time only the top cards of the discard pile and deck are visible 
to you or the computer (you can only see cards in your round). You will see the discard pile first. If you don't need it, 
you will see the deck. If you still don't want it, the deck top is added to the top of the discard pile. Then it comes 
the computer's round. Then yours.

Your goal is to rank your rack in the descending order from top to bottom, of course, before the computer complishes it.
Remember computer is clever, since I've implement a really good stretagy for it.
